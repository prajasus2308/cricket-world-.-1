      <h2>Rules of International Cricket</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A cricket match is played between two teams of 11 players each; one acts as captain.</li>
        <li>The game consists of innings where each team bats and bowls; the number varies by match format (Test, ODI, T20).</li>
        <li>The pitch: 22 yards long; wickets at each end with three stumps and two bails each.</li>
        <li><b>Bat</b>: Wooden, max length 38 inches, width 4.25 inches. <b>Ball</b>: 5.5–5.75 oz, 8.81–9 inches circumference.</li>
        <li>Runs are scored by running between wickets or hitting the ball to the boundary (4 or 6 runs).</li>
        <li>Dismissal types: Bowled, Caught, LBW, Run-out, Stumped, Hit wicket, Obstructing the field, Timed out, etc.</li>
        <li>No-ball, Wide, Bye, Leg-bye rules exist for fair play and scoring adjustments.</li>
        <li>The over: 6 legal balls; no two consecutive overs by the same bowler.</li>
        <li>The umpire's decision is final on the field.</li>
        <li>Spirit of Cricket: Respect for all, play hard but fair, accept umpire decisions, show sportsmanship.</li>
      </ul>

      <i><h2>Rules of Gully Cricket</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The one who plays well becomes a captain.</li>
        <li>First ball faced by every batsman is a 'trial ball'—batter can't be out off it.</li>
        <li>If the ball is hit too far or lost, the batsman is responsible for retrieving or replacing it.</li>
        <li> catch OUT: If a fielder catches the ball in hand sometimes <mark>one tip one hand</mark> [the feilder should catch the ball in one hand after one bounce ] the batsman is out.</li>
        <li>No LBW rule. Batsman must not block the stumps fully.</li>
        <li>Bowling can have informal rules— like we can throw by our hand bowling action may differ</li>
        <li> sometimes Last man stands: Last remaining batsman plays alone, no non-striker runner.</li>
        <li>The umpire is often a member of the batting team's squad or some elder knowledgeable people.</li>
        <li>Extra fielders may be distributed to even out teams.</li>
        <li>the boundary depends on the shape of feild</li>

      <h2>Indian Cricket History</h2>
      <p>India's love affair with cricket began in the 18th century and grew to a national passion by the 20th. The country gained Test status in 1932 and achieved its first Test victory against England in 1952. Over the decades, legendary players like Kapil Dev, Sunil Gavaskar, Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, MS Dhoni, and Virat Kohli have become icons for millions.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>India won its first ICC Men’s World Cup in 1983, a defining moment for Indian cricket.</li>
        <li>The team has since won all major ICC tournaments, including multiple World Cups and Champions Trophies.</li>
        <li>Cricket has united a diverse nation, bringing pride and joy across generations.</li>
